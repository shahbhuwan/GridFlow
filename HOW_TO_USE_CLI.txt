How to Use the GridFlow Command-Line Interface (CLI)
This tool has been installed in a dedicated virtual environment
named 'gridflow_env' to keep its dependencies separate from your
system's Python.

To use the 'gridflow' command, you must follow these steps each time
you open a new terminal.

--- [ STEP 1: Activate the Environment ] ---
Before you can run any commands, you must activate the virtual environment.
   1. Open a new Command Prompt (or terminal).
   2. Navigate to the GridFlow project folder where this file is located.
   3. Run the following activation command:
      call gridflow_env\Scripts\activate.bat

You will know the environment is active because your command prompt
will now start with '(gridflow_env)', like this:

(gridflow_env) D:\Research\Github\GridFlow>_

--- [ STEP 2: Use the GridFlow Command ] ---
Once the environment is active, you can use the 'gridflow' command
from anywhere.

Here are some examples to get you started:
   - To see the main help message and list all available tools:
     gridflow -h
   - To get detailed help for a specific tool (e.g., cmip6):
     gridflow cmip6 -h
   - To run a pre-configured demo download for PRISM data:
     gridflow prism --demo

--- [ STEP 3: Deactivate the Environment (Optional) ] ---
When you are finished using the tool, you can deactivate the
environment to return to your normal command prompt.

Simply type the following command:

deactivate
